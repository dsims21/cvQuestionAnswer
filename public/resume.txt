It is not often you closely collaborate with someone whose talents span so many areas. Technical, analytical, tactical. That’s just the start.

Daniel is extremely reliable and trustworthy, and I knew that any project with him on it would be driven to completion and be successful. Not only is he a do-er, but he also fosters a fantastic work environment.
